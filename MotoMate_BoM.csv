This project is designed to fit a blue-colored ""GY-NEO6MV2"" breakout board, which is a cheap module that is widely available on eBay / Amazon / AliExpress / TaoBao / etc. These modules are much cheaper from Eastern listings than from Western ones. I've noticed that red-colored versions of this GPS module seem to have a different pinout that won't fit, so double-check the module's silkscreen markings against this project's schematic before you order one. Sorry that I can't link to a more reliable source; I can't endorse any particular third-party marketplace seller, including the one linked to here, and ordering from eBay-style sellers is never a completely sure bet. Maybe in the future I'll try to integrate the ublox module itself on the board."

These are cheap and widely-available from places like eBay / AliExpress / TaoBao / etc. DigiKey doesn't carry them, but using surplus 'off-brand' displays often saves about $10-20 per board for us hobbyists. Double-check the pinout against the listing you buy from, and consider using a different vendor or a forwarding service if you aren't familiar with ordering from TaoBao."
J9,Pin Header,"0.1""",1x3,N/A,$0.00,"Flat single-side 3-pin connector for adding a ""K-Wire"" interface board later on.
