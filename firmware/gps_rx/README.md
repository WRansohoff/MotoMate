# GPS Reception Test

This project initializes the display and the UART connected to the GPS module, and draws the NMEA data received from the GPS module to the display. It's hard to read the raw data, but once enough satellites are acquired, it should print out the latitude and longitude in a fairly easy-to-parse format.
