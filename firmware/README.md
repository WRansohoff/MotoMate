# Test Firmwares

These projects test various parts of the board. The directories are named after the functionality that a project tests. These use shared functionality from the libraries located under `../fw_lib/`.

The `v1_testsuite` project is an attempt to pull all of these examples into one firmware image which lets the user test each part of the board from a menu, although that will depend on the display and buttons working. It's a work-in-progress, but so is this entire repository.
