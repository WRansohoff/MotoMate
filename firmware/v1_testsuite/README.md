# Test Suite, Version 1

This project initializes every part of the board, and displays a menu which lets the user perform various tests.

Currently, it has a main menu and a few different options. The 'back' button returns to the main menu from each individual test, and unused buttons will sometimes change the background and text color. Currently only the 'view raw GPS messages' test works, and the other parts are works-in-progress.

It won't actually test every part of the board for a little while, since I haven't done anything with the USB plug or the SD card interface, but those are on the to-do list.
