# Test Suite, Version 1

This project initializes every part of the board, and displays a menu which lets the user perform various tests.

Currently it just prints the UART messages received from the GPS modules, and pressing the buttons will change the background and text color. But I'd like to add a menu of some sort for choosing different tests.

It won't actually test every part of the board for a little while, since I haven't done anything with the USB plug or the SD card interface, but those are on the to-do list.
